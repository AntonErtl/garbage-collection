<title>A Forth Garbage Collector</title>

<h1>A Forth Garbage Collector</h1>

or, more precisely,

<h1>Storage Allocation with Automatic Reclamation</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

When an object (in this paper, an object is just a chunk of memory) is
no longer needed, its storage can be reclaimed and reused for other
objects. The problem is finding out when an object is no longer needed
(in CS terminology: the object dies). The ANS Forth memory-allocation
wordset leaves this problem to the programmer: he must put explicit
<code>free</code> calls in the program.

<p>For sufficiently complex programs this approach leads to

<dl>

<dt>Bugs

<dd>The program knows that an object is needed locally (in one
context), but usually does not know whether an object is needed
globally. If it frees the object as soon as it does no longer need it
locally, the <em>dangling reference</em> bug rears its ugly head:
other contexts try to access memory that has been reused for other
purposes; in the best case the result is a crash.

<p>If, OTOH, the program assumes conservatively that the object will
be needed when it actually is dead, the result is a <em>memory
leak</em>. Depending on the application, this kind of bug is
acceptable or disastrous.

<dt>Inefficiency <dd>There are various programming practices for
dealing with the problem of the missing global information: A common
approach is to copy the object instead of just passing the address
around; in the extreme case, every context has its own copy, and can
safely free this copy, when it is done. Needless to say, this is
inefficient in both time and space.<!-- Henry Baker -->

<dt>Maintenance Problems <dd>For every change of the program that may
affect the lifetime of some object the programmer must deal with all
contexts in which the object appears. I.e., many abstractions are
broken, in particular, abstract data types. I leave the ensuing
maintenance troubles to your imagination.

</dl>

To avoid these problems, high-level languages have automatic storage
reclamation, also known as <em>garbage collection</em>. The program
just allocates the objects, it does not have to free them explicitly;
the system reclaims the memory after the objects die.

<p>The topic of garbage collection regularly comes up in <a
href="news:comp.lang.forth">comp.lang.forth</a>, about twice a
year. After the last time (in February 1998), I finally sat down and
wrote one.

<p>The result is a conservative mark-and-sweep collector. It has an
administrative memory overhead of 1.6% (with another 1.6% needed
during allocation), which is usually better than the constant
per-object overhead of typical implementations of the memory
allocation wordset (in addition to this administrative overhead there
is also the more significant fragmentation problem, which should be
similar for both approaches).

<h2>Usage</h2>

Basically you allocate memory with <code>alloc ( usize -- addr ior
)</code>, just as with <code>allocate</code>. There is no need (and no
way) to explicitly free this memory. The address returned is naturally
aligned for every Forth data type (including <code>dfaligned</code>;
natural alignment is alignment to multiples of the data type
size). The memory is initialized with zeroes.

<p>However, <tt>gc.fs</tt> needs to know if there is a reference to
the object (if there is none, the object is certainly dead, and its
storage can be recycled). You have to follow some rules to make sure
<tt>gc.fs</tt> notices the reference:

<ul>

<li>The reference must reside on the data stack, in a memory location
specified with <code>root-address</code> (see below), or in a
naturally aligned cell in a referenced <code>alloc</code>ed object
(<em>naturally aligned cell</em> means that its address is divisible
by <code>1 cells</code>).  I would have liked to add the return
and locals stack, but unfortunately there is no standard way to access
them, so they are out.

<li>The reference is the address where the object starts (i.e., the
address returned by <code>alloc</code>). I.e., you cannot use
addresses pointing into the middle of an object (e.g., a pointer
walking an array), unless you also keep a pointer to the start in a
place where <tt>gc.fs</tt> will find it.

</ul>

You can declare with <code>root-address ( a-addr -- )</code> that
<code>a-addr</code> is a memory location that may contain a reference
to an <code>alloc</code>ed object.


<p>Before you can enjoy these luxuries, you have to load and
initialize the garbage collector; there are two ways to do this:

<h3>Initialize when loading</h3>

You simply load <tt>gc.fs</tt> with the following three values on the
stack:

<ul>

<li>The size (in address units) of the memory region that
<tt>gc.fs</tt> manages and can give you with <code>alloc</code>.  This
memory cannot be extended later, so better make it large enough. This
memory is allocated using <code>allocate</code>; for good Forth/OS
combinations (e.g., Gforth on Linux) you can ask for a lot, without
having to pay for it until the memory is actually used (however, you
usually have to pay for the administrative overhead (1/64)
immediately (but only in virtual memory)).

<li>A verbosity flag: in verbose mode (true) you see when the garbage
collector becomes active (except on systems that do buffered I/O
(e.g., Gforth <0.4.0)).

<li>A flag that selects the mark method: true selects a recursive
method that is a little faster, but requires deep data and return
stacks, if you have deep data structures (e.g., long lists); false
selects a pointer reversal method that is gentle on the stacks, but it
is slightly slower and interrupting it leaves you with corrupt data
structures. Which one is better for you depends on your environment.

</ul>

To work well with <code>needs</code>, loading <tt>gc.fs</tt> does not
consume these values, so you have to remove them yourself. A typical
loading line might look like

<pre>
64 1024 * 1024 * ( 64MB ) true false s" gc.fs" included drop 2drop
</pre>

<h3>Separate initialization</h3>

This option is useful if you want to put the garbage collector in an
image, and initialize after you have loaded the image into the Forth
system (on many Forth systems the region <code>allocate</code>d during
initialization does not survive this operation).

<p>For this, you have to load <tt>gc4image.fs</tt> with one argument, the
flag selecting the mark method (see above). This flag is not consumed
by loading the code. E.g.,

<pre>
false s" gc.fs" included drop
</pre>

To initialize the garbage collector, you have to set the size and
verbosity (see above), and then call <code>init-gc</code>. E.g.:

<pre>
64 1024 * 1024 * ( 64MB )  gc-setmem
true gc-verbose
init-gc
</pre>


<h2>Caveats</h2>

In the Forth tradition, <tt>gc.fs</tt> is not foolproof. It merely
turns a global problem into a local problem that is much easier to
deal with.

<h3>Dangling references</h3>

If you have a reference to an object that does not point to the start,
or that is in a place where the garbage collector does not look (e.g.,
the return stack, some variable you have not declared as
<code>root-address</code>, or an unaligned cell in an object), then
this reference can become a dangling reference.

<p><tt>gc.fs</tt> helps you find such bugs in the following way: It
writes over the memory as soon as it reclaims it; this makes it easier
for you to notice and find the bug. You can force a garbage collection
(and its associated memory overwriting) with <code>collect-garbage (
-- )</code>; this can be a good idea just before checking a data
structure for consistency during debugging.

<h3>Memory consumption</h3>

Like every other garbage collector, <tt>gc.fs</tt> approximates
liveness conservatively by assuming that every referenced object will
be needed again. You can explicitly destroy references that will not
be used again (e.g., by overwriting them with 0) to ensure minimal
memory consumption. This is usually not necessary, but for pointers to
large data structures it may be worthwhile. It is essential for, e.g.,
queues implemented as linked lists, where you have to destroy the
reference at the tail of the queue to avoid unbounded growth.

<p>Note that destroying a reference is easier than using
<code>free</code>: You just have to decide whether one reference is no
longer needed (and you can usually do that with local information),
whereas with <code>free</code> you have to decide whether all
references are no longer needed.

<p>The Forth system has no type information, so <tt>gc.fs</tt>
conservatively has to assume that everything is an address (at least
everything that is aligned like an address and is in the right
place). As a consequence, some integer can be interpreted as a
reference and may cause a dead object to be kept around. Usually, this
is no big problem, but if you use huge circular data
structures, it can be a problem: a spurious reference to just one
object in the data structure will keep the whole data structure alive;
at least that's what <tt>gc.fs</tt> thinks. Similarly, for long linear
lists, one spurious reference will on average keep half of the list
from being reclaimed. If you have such data structures, be prepared
for irregular memory consumption. For more information on this topic,
read [<a href="#boehm93">boehm93</a>].

<h3>Writing where you should not</h3>

If you write in places not given to you by the Forth system or
<tt>gc.fs</tt> (e.g., if you write beyond the end of a chunk of memory
you <code>alloc</code>ed), you may damage the data structures used by
the garbage collector. This may result in mysterious bugs.

<p>To make it easier to reveal such problems, <tt>gc.fs</tt> includes
some consistency checks of its data structures. At assertion level 2
(<code>2 assert-level !</code> before loading <tt>gc.fs</tt>), a
number of checks are done, including a consistency check of the
freelists before (and, to check against collector bugs, after) each
garbage collection. At assertion level 3, the collector additionally
checks the freelists before each <code>alloc</code>ation (this causes
an extreme slowdown and is mainly useful for overnight regression test
runs).

<h2>Dynamic resizing</h2>

In an earlier discussion (March 1997), Mark Andrew Amerman wanted to
be able to resize objects after allocation; he was even prepared to
pay for this by requiring another indirection for every access.

<p>Although <tt>gc.fs</tt> does not support dynamic resizing directly,
you can have it at the cost of an extra indirection, with the
following programming technique:

<p>In addition to the object to be resized, <code>alloc</code>ate a
one-cell object: the handle, which contains a pointer to the
object. Always access the object indirectly, do not keep direct
pointers to it. In this way you know that only the handle points to
the object to be resized, so when you want to resize it, you can
simply <code>alloc</code>ate an object of the new size, copy the
contents from the old to the new object, and store the address of the
new object in the handle.

<p>This gives you resizable objects, at the price that Amerman was
willing to pay, without imposing any additional overhead for
non-resizable objects.

<h2>Tuning</h2>

<tt>gc.fs</tt> generally uses only a part of the memory it
manages. This policy allows you to give it a huge amount of memory to
manage, as preparation for the worst case, without consuming that much
real (and, for good OSes, even virtual) memory before it is necessary.

<p>The amount of memory actually used is determined in the following
way:

<pre>
memory= (a * livemem / b) + c
</pre>

Where livemem is the amount of memory in live objects after the last
garbage collection, and a, b, and c are tunable parameters. By
default, a/b is 3, and c is 256KB.

<p>You can tune these parameters for your application: You can reduce
the memory, at the cost of a higher number of garbage collections, or
you can increase it to reduce the number of garbage collections. Note
that if you reduce memory too much (to less than about 2*livemem), the
number of garbage collections rises extremely. And if a
garbage-collection does not free an appropriate memory chunk,
<code>alloc</code> will grab more memory regardless of the limit.

<p>The following code sequence demonstrates the adjustment of
parameters by resetting them to their default values:

<pre>
also garbage-collector
3 1 ( a b ) size-factor 2!
256 1024 * ( c ) grain/ size-offset !
set-current-limit
previous
</pre>

The <a href="space-vs-time.eps">graph</a><!-- caption: space limit
(logarithmic) vs. run-time on a 300MHz 21064A --> shows the effects of
setting the limit to a fixed amount of memory. The benchmark (also
described in Section <a href="#efficiency">Efficiency</a>) constantly
has 500-1000 live objects of size 16-80 bytes (average: 51
bytes). Note that the amount of memory actually used is about 50KB
during most of the benchmark unless the limit is higher (so reducing
the limit below that just makes the benchmark run slower without
having a significant effect on memory consumption). The jaggedness of
the timings in the middle area is probably due to the freelist
implementation and the random sizes of the allocated objects.

<h2><a name="efficiency">Efficiency</a></h2>

Many people think that garbage collection is slower than explicit
deallocation with <code>free</code>. 

<p>In general, this is wrong: copying collectors make it possible to
use a very fast, <code>allot</code>-like allocator, and the collection
overhead can be made arbitrarily small by using more memory
(techniques like generational garbage collectors make it possible to
reduce collection overhead without taking as much memory). In
contrast, a memory allocator with explicit deallocation has to manage
a freelist, which creates quite a bit of overhead.

<p>However, a conservative non-copying collector also has to manage a
freelist, so it will typically be somewhat slower than using explicit
deallocation. But if we take the inefficiency of the programming
techniques used to handle explicit deallocation into account, and
spend the time we saved on programming and debugging correct
<code>free</code>s for performance tuning, garbage collection is
easily faster.

<p>You may be more interested in real timings than in theoretical
discussions, therefore I have converted one of the test programs into
a benchmark: <tt>bench-gc.fs</tt>. It allocates 250,000 objects of
size 2 cells+0..63 aus (10,793,040 bytes on a byte-addressed 32-bit
machine); 1,000 of these objects (41,800 bytes) are alive at the end.

<p>You can load <tt>bench-gc.fs</tt> with a parameter between 1 and 6
on the stack, resulting in different storage allocation options. You
can run the whole suite with <code>make bench</code> on your
system. The following table shows the parameter, the storage
allocation option, and the time used (user time or user+system time)
on Gforth-0.3.0 on a 486-66 running Linux.

<pre>
1 GC with default tuning           23.33
2 alloc-nocollect and free-chunk   32.63
3 allocate and free                 5.64
				 
4 GC tuned for no collection       10.55+0.66
5 allocate                          4.76+1.02
6 allot                             4.67+0.61
</pre>

Note that this benchmark does hardly more than allocating and forgeting
objects, making these operations the dominant factor in its
run-time. For an application that does something useful, the difference
between the rows will be smaller.

<p>The first row shows garbage collection as it is normally used, the
second uses the freelist management words of the garbage collector to
implement explicit deallocation (i.e., without using the garbage
collector). Comparing these two numbers is probably the fairest
comparison of the two approaches. Surprisingly, explicit deallocation
is slower (by a factor of 1.4) than garbage collection here. I have
some theories to explain this, but no empirical support for any of
them. Anyway, this evidence suggests that the overhead of garbage
collection is small compared to the time spent in freelist management.

<p>Of course, for explicit deallocation one would usually use
<code>allocate</code> and <code>free</code>. The result of using this
combination is shown in the third row. On Gforth it is much faster
than the two <tt>gc.fs</tt>-based solutions. My explanation for this
is:

<ul>

<li><tt>gc.fs</tt> runs on a threaded code system, whereas
<code>allocate</code> and <code>free</code> are primitives that invoke
C functions that were compiled into native code with an optimizing C
compiler. [ertl&maierhofer95] reports that Gforth's threaded code is
4-8 times slower than optimized C code.

<li><tt>gc.fs</tt> has been written for simplicity (to avoid bugs),
whereas the C functions called by Gforth on <code>allocate</code> and
<code>free</code> have probably been written for speed (it is
well-known that slow implementations of these functions result in
significant overhead for allocation-intensive programs).

</ul>

The other three rows are for allocation without deallocation. In
contrast to the first three rows, which had almost no system time
(<0.05s), here we see some signficant system times, which probably is
due to the 10+MB used by these benchmarks (for security reasons the OS
must zero the pages it gives to a process). For the following
discussion only the user time is important.

<p>By comparing row 1, 2 and 4 we see the overhead of garbage
collection, freeing and freelist management (for row 4 the freelist is
empty, and therefore fast). The comparison of line 4 and 5 again shows
the performance advantage of optimized C code over Gforth's threaded
code. A comparison of row 4 and row 6 shows that even with an empty
freelist, <code>alloc</code> has a significant overhead over
<code>allot</code>: checking that the freelist is empty, remembering
the borders between objects, checking whether a garbage collection
should be performed, zeroing the returned memory.
