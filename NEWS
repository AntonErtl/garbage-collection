User-visible changes between 1.1 and 1.2:

Bugfix that makes the garbage collector portable to systems with basic
data types with sizes that are not powers of 2 (e.g., bigforth,
vfxlin).

User-visible changes between 1.0 and 1.1:

The initialization has been packaged into words; by including
gc4image.fs, you now get an uninitialized version that can survive a
save-system (at least on Gforth).  This change is due to Lars Krueger.
